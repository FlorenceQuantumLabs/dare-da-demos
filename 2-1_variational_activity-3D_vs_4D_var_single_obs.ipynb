    "\n",
    "In complex applications like flood or weather forecasting we use data assimilation to obtain a high-quality estimate of a state of a dynamical system, but we never know the true state exactly. Specific experiments where the `truth’ is known can be used when evaluating the performance of data assimilation schemes or exploring their sensitivities.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following activities, we perform synthetic experiments where we take a dynamical model and use it to generate a trajectory of a dynamical system. This trajectory is declared to be the \"truth\" and we will use it as an example to show how we can try to reconstruct it using data assimilation. We generate a background state and observations to use in the examples by adding noise to the \"true\" trajectory. This kind of setup is called an identical twin experiment.\n",

    "## 2. The Lorenz63 model\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the Lorenz 63 dynamical model in this activity. It is not necessary to be familiar with the model; the important thing to note is that it is an example of a dynamical model that shows chaotic behaviour – meaning that small changes in the initial state can result in very different trajectories. The model describes the change of three variables, which we denote x, y, and z (represented in the code as `x[0]`, `x[1]` and `x[2]` respectively).\n",
    "\n",
    "We run the model for some time (tmax = 10) and show the trajectories of each variable over time below. The trajectories of x, y, and z are also plotted together. This gives us the famous butterfly attractor, that is, the space to which the unperturbed system is typically drawn to. If the Lorenz 63 model is run using two slightly different sets of initial conditions, then after some time the two trajectories become distinct, and at a given time the two states may reside in different wings of the butterfly. For more information on the system see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system."

Assimilations using 3D-Var and 4D-Var data assimilation schemes illustrated their differences: 3D-Var performs assimilation at observation time only, hence the trajectory at previous times depends on background, whereas 4D-Var performs assimilation over a time window and the trajectory over previous times can be adjusted, which can result in improved analysis.
